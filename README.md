Process-Scheduling-Algo-Implemented
===================================

This is a simple c++ and java code for operating systems fundamental algorithms.
It includes a Dev-C++ project on simulating various process-scheduling algorithms.
others include:
1. File Allocation on hard disk algorithms - continuous and link list allocation.
2. Process Allocation on RAM - First Fit, First Empty.
3. Mutual Exclusion Algorithms - Banker Algorithm, Producer-Consumer Problem, Readers-Writers Problem.
